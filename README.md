# Muscle-sensor-IOT-GUI
Tkinter implementaion of  GUI paired with django framework and Arduino code to obtain muscle EMG data and show case graph in a visual modifiable format to user making use of python tkinter.
The use of Django helps scale the server to the network and maintain a database for storing the information.

Utilised DFRobot EMG sensor to retrive store and statistically plot muscle activity data in realtime
-Designed IOT device structure leveraging the use of Arduino WIFI for accessing wireless communication.
-Programmed means to allow user to export data in the form of CSV or JSON
-Developed local CSV database management for organied data flow and filtering
-Innovated and programmed Tkinter GUI to graphically visualise multiple aspects of the data and retrieve past data for visualisation.
-Made use of Django framework to expand usability horizons in the form of web applications
